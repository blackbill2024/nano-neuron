> 7 simple JavaScript functions that will give you a feeling of how machines can actually "learn"

## TL;DR

[NanoNeuron](https://github.com/trekhleb/nano-neuron) is _over-simplified_ version of a Neuron concept from the Neural Networks. NanoNeuron is trained to convert a temperature values from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

[NanoNeuron.js](https://github.com/trekhleb/nano-neuron/blob/master/NanoNeuron.js) code example contains 7 simple JavaScript functions (model prediction, cost calculation, forward and backwards propagation, training) that will give you a feeling of how machines can actually "learn". No 3rd-party libraries, no external data-sets and dependencies, only pure and simple JavaScript functions.

‚òùüèªThese functions by any means are **NOT** a complete guide to machine learning. A lot of machine learning concepts are skipped and over-simplified there! This simplification is done in purpose to give the reader a really **basic** understanding and feeling of how machines can learn and ultimately to make it possible for the reader to call it not a "machine learning MAGIC" but rather "machine learning MATH" ü§ì.

- @TODO: Training set split 70/30.
- @TODO: Input normalization.
- @TODO: Vectorized implementation instead of 'for' loop.
- @TODO: Activation function.
- @TODO: No local optimum. Use logarithm.
